# Conjugation Exercise Generator
LING 5200 Corpus Linguistics Final Project

# Purpose
Business Japanese can be very different from conversational Japanese. However, there does exist conjugations or equivalent phrases between the two. This project seeks to pick out sentences with these common business conjugations and present them to the user as a training exercise in order to solidify the conjugation.

# Method
I will use the [Business Scene Dialogue (BSD) corpus](https://github.com/tsuruoka-lab/BSD), a Japanese-English parallel corpus with written conversations in various business scenarios.
